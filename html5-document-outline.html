	<h1>HTML5 Document Outline</h1>
	<section>
		<h2>What I've Learned</h2>
		<p> A document outline is the foundation for code and content. It is used for a combination of reasons all making life easier for coders.</p>
		<section>
			<h3>Organization</h3>
				<p>A document outline is a table of contents. It defines what the page consists of through titled headers. This table of contents is used for search engines and screen readers.</p>
			<h3>Hierarchy</h3>
				<p>The document outline also states what is more or less important through headers. These headers are used to title each section. Different level headers (h1 through h6) are used to show their place within the outline. As an example, h2 is a subset of h1.</p>
			<h3>Grouping</h3>
				<p>Content is also grouped with sectioning elements. These are new to HTML5. This allows for better and more specific organization. This would include creating a section for articles, navagation (nav), or side content (aside) as well as basic sections. Each sectioning element should have a title and therefore a header. Nested within each section, headers may start again from h1 or can follow the semantics of the entire outline. There can also be sectioning elements within sectioning elements as well.</p>
				<h4>Hidden Grouping</h4>
				<p>Sectioning roots are hidden sections from the outline. They are ways to section the content for context, but these are not important to the structure of the document. These include block quotes and other annotations that create a subset in the content.</p>
