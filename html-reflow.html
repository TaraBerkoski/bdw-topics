		<h2>What I've Learned</h2>
		<p>Reflow is the process by which a browser reads and deciphers HTML and CSS that has to do with the layout of a page including placement, dimensions and shapes. Reflow is triggered by changes in DOM nodes, hiding or moving a DOM node, adding a stylesheet or changing style properties, and user actions such as screen resizing or scrolling.</p>
		<p>Understanding reflow (and repaint) is extremely important for developers. The effects of various document properties suchs as depth and rules can make reflow (and repaint) faster or slower. Knowing how each works and how reflow is triggered from each helps when creating the HTML and CSS.</p>
