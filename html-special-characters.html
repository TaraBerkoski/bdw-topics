		<h1>HTML Special Characters</h1>
		<p>Puncuation, accents and other special characters must be coded into HTML. This is because not all operating systems and web browsers use the same character set. To make sure that these parts of the content are produced properly, an entity, or specfic code, must be used that defines the character allowing it to be visible universally.</p>
		<p>Another reason why some characters are not read properly throughout HTML is because the characters are reserved for specific meanings to the code produced. These include characters used in markup such as the less than and greater than symbols for example.
